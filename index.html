          <p>I played Club soccer for 8 years. I was on the Albion ECNL (Elite Clubs National League) for 3 years. This opportunity required me to travel around the United States to play soccer at showcases and events in San Diego, Las Vegas, Chicago, and Florida. I spent an average of 6 to 8 hours a week with this club for the entire 8 years. </p>

We created an interface in which a game of 3-dimensional tic-tac-toe (4x4x4) could be played. After struggling to find an optimal method to create an AI to play the game, I discovered the minimax method online. I implemented this idea of alpha-beta pruning in my code in which the AI would select a move after recursing through a certain depth of outcomes.   </p>

              Dodge Game was a school assignment that required me to create text files that outlined a map for each level of the game. When the program is run, the level is interpreted from the text files which allowed for a great deal of customizability for each level. This game was also a side scroller which required me to use calculations to keep the player at the center of the user's screen.    </p>

              Chat room required me to create a server, a server listener, a client, and a client lister.

              Driving Along was a school assignment for my Game development course. I created a unity object that had a velocity and an angle. I had to use trigonometry in order to move the car in its orientated direction and the concepts of velocity and acceleration in order to replicate a real environment.    </p>

            <p class ="card-body">
              Snake was a summer project as well. This project was a lot more challenging than I anticipated. At first, I wasn't sure how to add a unit of length to the snake over a certain time constraint. I also struggled with keeping the snake moving in a grid position. To solve the former issue I used a thread to create a timer. And for the latter, I used a boolean value that determined a new direction, then set the movement of the snake in that position after it reached the end of a row or column.   </p>
